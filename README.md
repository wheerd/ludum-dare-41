# City Rhythm

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

A game made for [Ludum Dare 41](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/$75136).
The theme was "Combine 2 Incompatible Genres" and the two genres I tried to combine is rhythm + city builder.

You can play the [web version](http://wheerd.de/ld41/) or download the [Windows version](https://github.com/wheerd/ludum-dare-41/releases/tag/v0.2).

The game was made using [Unity Version 2017.4.1f1](https://unity3d.com/).
The music was made with [BeepBox](https://www.beepbox.co/).
Texts were made using [Cool Text](https://cooltext.com/).
